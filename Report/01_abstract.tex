\chapter*{Abstract}

In this project, we explore application of deep learning for short-term traffic
flow prediction to real data collected from vehicle detectors in the German city
of Ingolstadt. After describing the task, we provide an overview of various
state-of-the-art methods developed in the area to select the most relevant
approach for our problem. We find the DBN-KELM model \cite{Han.2020} as the most
fitting for our purposes and describe all steps of this method in details. Then,
we implement the procedure using PyTorch, fixing and adjusting the given data
set. Finally, we tune the hyper parameters and test our implementation. Our
experiments give mixed results indicating a room for improvement, but suggesting
this area of research as highly promising. We conclude our report by
interpreting different sides of the outcome and suggesting possible ways to
enhance the method's accuracy.
